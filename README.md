# DigiPopRecipes

**DigiPopRecipes** is a curated collection of methods, workflows, and examples for generating and analyzing virtual patients in Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP), using the Julia programming language.

## Purpose

This repository aims to:
- Demonstrate various approaches to virtual population generation.
- Compare different analysis strategies on consistent model examples.
- Serve as a tutorial and practical guide for modelers working in QSP.
- Provide reusable Julia code for each step of the workflow.

## Contents

- `docs/`: Documentation and explanations of methods.
- `models/`: Example QSP models used in tutorials and analyses.
- `recipes/`: Method-specific pipelines and analysis examples.
- `notebooks/`: (Optional) Interactive Julia or Pluto notebooks.
